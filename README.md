This is a full-fledged, practically standalone Spotify client in a single Lua file (yes, you read that correctly), almost everything you can do in a full-fledged client can be done from within this interface. It's meant to be a quick and convenient way to manage your listening on the fly, much like a program launcher, except for your music. There's a lot you can do in this interface -and I mean A LOT- So I'd rather list the things the limitations instead:

- Remove from queue (Spotify Web API limitation)
  > Local queue can be implemented as an alternative. In which case it will provide full control over its functions. However...
  > - It adds complexity and relative blaot for what it's supposed to do.
  > - Local implementation inherently means zero sync with other Spotify clients/connect devices if you use any.
- Podcast management
  > Not that spotirofi can't do it, I simply didn't implement support for it, for two primary reasons;
  > - Spotify's API doesn't expose some of the key features that help make listening to podcasts accessible, like chapter management.
  > - This may sound subjective, but it's a relatively niche medium to cover.

# The philosophy behind spotirofi
Spotify clients (official one included) are too big and often glorified in comparison to what they're supposed to do. An optimal music player (to me, personally) should be something small, clear, easy and quick to interact with, which no player that I know of delivers. The original iteration and purpose of spotirofi was to act as a quick control panel for [spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player) which back then was my Spotify client of choice, but even that player -despite its speed and accessibility- wasn't enough for my use case. Spotirofi was meant to bridge that gap, think of it as a remote control for your stereo.

But as spotirofi's development pressed on, it became mature enough to be its own player, with its own small but comprehensive ecosystem. The idea was to be able to quickly access my library from anywhere, and do whatever I'd typically do on a desktop Spotify client without having to bring up a window or switch to it, disrupting my workflow in the process. That's the point of spotirofi. A music player should not have to be a dedicated space governing and imposing its own rules instead of catering to the user. Music players can be better, smaller and quicker without having to sacrifice functionality or user experience.

But most importantly, a music player should pretty much know its place. It's not the user's center of attention.

The script's first run will automatically take you to Spotify's authentication page (two separate pages in fact, that's just a ```spotifyd``` quirk). At launch, it will notify you that it's building cache and will automatically run the daemons and display the main menu, at that point you can start using the rofi interface right away.

# Functionality
- Your paths are nested and retained by default, given the number of menus and submenus. This is why some custom keybinds had to be set in place, instead of reopening the main menu every time and going through multiple depth levels.
- Cache gets updated every 12 hours, a safeguard in case you made external changes to your library from, say; your phone or another Spotify client. There's also a manual option to refresh the cache, <b>but only use it when you absolutely have to.</b> Your activity on the player is dynamically and locally refreshed anyway, so you'll probably never have to use this feature.

# Dependencies
- Spotify Premium
- spotifyd
- rofi
- cjson
- lua 5.4+
- playerctl
- curl
- wl-clipboard
- notify-send
- perl
- pgrep
- A nerd font

# Installation
- Drop both directories in ```~/.config/rofi/``` and assign a keybind for ```spotirofi.lua``` in your compositor's config
- chmod +x ```spotirofi.lua``` to make it executable
- Run ```spotirofi.lua``` and enjoy

# Controls
Given the scope, you can be easily multiple levels deep as you navigate through menus, so it was important to set some keybinds in place for convenience and faster -hopefully organic- interactions.
> Keybinds can also be viewed from <b>Main > System > Keybinds</b>
